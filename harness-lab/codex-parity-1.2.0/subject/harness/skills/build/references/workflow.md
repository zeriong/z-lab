# Generated harness-engineering contract

This public contract is self-contained. It is based on the requirements in this
plugin, and does not require a private setup guide or research document.

Generate the project-specific `harness-engineering/SKILL.md` with these eleven phases.
Use the selected host's real paths and reviewer dispatch; retain the project's
existing commands and include only rules derived from the target repository.

0. **Intake:** resolve the requested outcome, scope and constraints; reuse already
   answered questions. A bypass-marked request skips this workflow.
1. **Reconnaissance:** read affected code, check claims against files and usages, and
   record `file:line` evidence. Recheck the affected scope after any patch.
2. **Rules:** select the applicable project-rules and convention references. Separate
   deterministic gate rules from advisory guidance; introduce no unsupported rules.
3. **Plan:** choose the smallest change satisfying the confirmed outcome and name
   the checks that establish success. Resolve material unknowns before implementation.
4. **Implement:** make the scoped change following the evidenced project conventions.
5. **Behavior checks:** run the relevant existing tests and add coverage where behavior
   changes or a regression needs it. Record failures and their evidence.
6. **Static checks:** run the lint/typecheck commands locked in intake; record the
   actual results, including any unavailable checks.
7. **Documentation:** update affected convention examples and user-facing behavior
   documentation; keep citations and keyword indexes consistent with the code.
8. **Review gate:** run `review-gate.sh --mode=full`, then obtain the two independent
   one-shot reviews specified in the generated review section below. Main synthesizes the results;
   reviewers propose changes only. Grade patches against the six quality axes. Every
   applied patch returns to Phase 1. Stop after three review/regression iterations
   with the remaining findings if the gate does not pass.
9. **Final verification:** verify the actual final diff, tests and remaining findings.
   Never call an unavailable or failed check a pass.
10. **Delivery:** report changed behavior, evidence and limitations. Commit or publish
    only when the user has authorized that action.

The prompt hook injects the generated project-rules and this generated workflow body.
For a bypass prompt (`!` prefix, `harness 빼고`, `without harness`, `skip harness`,
`no harness`), inject a short `BYPASS MODE` note instead. Bypass applies to this harness
workflow only and does not disable other project instructions or unrelated hooks.

## Review section to include in the generated skill

Resolve this section for the selected host; do not leave references to the build
plugin or its SKILL.md. Name the actual project-local gate and rule paths.

- Run the project's gate in full mode first: exit 0 passes, exit 1 is a violation,
  exit 2 is a configuration/execution error. A missing command is not a pass.
- Invoke two fresh, independent read-only reviewers with no prior review history.
  Claude uses its Opus and Sonnet panel. Codex uses architecture and gate reviewers;
  embed the `HARNESS_CODEX_ARCH_MODEL/EFFORT` and `HARNESS_CODEX_GATE_MODEL/EFFORT`
  resolution rules from the adapter, defaulting to the main session's actual values.
  Embed the available native dispatch route or the separate `CXC_MODE=off codex exec
  --ephemeral -s read-only` recipe with explicit model, effort, cwd and prompt-file stdin.
- Give both the same complete diff, rule bodies, convention evidence, generated file
  contents and direct verification results. Add the individual role focus. Each must
  return JSON with `findings`, `fact_check_misses`, `gate_evasions`, `quality_scores`
  (srp, comment_clarity, kiss, dry, yagni, cognitive_ease; each 0–5 with evidence), and
  `patches_suggested`. Reviewers report only; main owns edits.
- Main verifies findings, requires no fact-check misses or gate evasions and an average
  of at least 3.5 from **each** reviewer, and records its synthesis. Any applied patch
  returns to Phase 1. Three review/regression iterations is the hard limit; report
  unresolved findings instead of inventing approval.
