# Host: Claude Code

You are Claude. Your vendor is Anthropic.

## Main
Run as Opus. Use high effort or more for planning and triage; ordinary effort is fine
for task gates. Reviewing `codex-bulk` work yourself needs `CXC_REVIEW_EFFORT` (`xhigh`)
or `max`; below that, start the Claude reviewer form instead.

## Reaching each lane

| Lane | Standalone transport | Orca transport |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-fast` | `claude -p` worker form in the task's worktree (transport-standalone.md) | Orca worker, agent `claude`, `--model ${CXC_CLAUDE_WORKER:-sonnet} --effort ${CXC_WORKER_EFFORT:-high}` |
| `codex-bulk` | `codex exec` worker form (transport-standalone.md) | Orca worker, agent `codex`, `--model ${CXC_WORKER_MODEL:-gpt-6-luna} --effort ${CXC_WORKER_EFFORT:-high}` |
| `main` | yourself | yourself |

A native subagent can't pin its effort — subagent definitions and the Agent tool take a
model but no effort, so it runs at your session's — which is why `claude-fast` uses the
CLI form. Check the other vendor with `command -v codex`. If missing → single-vendor mode.

## Review routing, resolved for this host

| Author | Reviewer |
|---|---|
| `claude-fast` (Sonnet) | Codex `CXC_REVIEW_MODEL` (`gpt-6-sol`) at `xhigh`, read-only |
| `main` (you) | Codex `CXC_REVIEW_MODEL` (`gpt-6-sol`) at `xhigh`, read-only |
| `codex-bulk` (Luna) | **you**, if you run as Opus at `xhigh` or `max`; otherwise the Claude reviewer form (Opus, `xhigh`) |
| High-risk final, only if the user approved it | Codex `CXC_FINAL_MODEL`, read-only |

Single-vendor mode: the reviewer is a fresh Opus instance through the Claude reviewer form
(`xhigh`), given only `plan.md`, `decisions.md`, and the diff.

## Native context
You read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` skills, rules, hooks and MCP natively (and `AGENTS.md`
in directories with no `CLAUDE.md`). Codex workers and reviewers read none of the
`CLAUDE.md` side unless it is bridged — follow `context-bridge.md`, and remember that
your hooks never fire on Codex-written code.

## Host notes
- CLI workers return only their final message. Tell them to use the return format
  exactly; you don't see their intermediate reasoning.
- This plugin's `UserPromptSubmit` hook also fires in `claude -p` sessions. Start every
  CLI worker and reviewer with `CXC_MODE=off` so they don't receive the mode note.
- Pair with hooks (`PreToolUse`/`Stop`) for hard gates such as the cycle cap.
