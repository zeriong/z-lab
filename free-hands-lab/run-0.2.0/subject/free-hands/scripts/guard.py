"""free-hands hook guard. Usage: guard.py prompt|session|ask|stop  (hook JSON on stdin)

While `.free-hands/goal.md` is active and has open items (`- [ ]`), it denies the ask tool, keeps the session from
stopping (up to max_iterations) and re-injects the rules after a restart or compaction. With no active goal it only
routes the word "free-hands" in a prompt to the entry question. Any error means "no effect": a hook must never trap a
session because of a broken goal file.
