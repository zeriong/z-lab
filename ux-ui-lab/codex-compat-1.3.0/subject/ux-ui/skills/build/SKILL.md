name: build
description: Build or change any frontend UI end-to-end, measured and reviewed, without extra user instruction. Use whenever implementing/editing UI — components, pages, screens, styles, layout, design tweaks. Drives chrome-devtools to MEASURE the real render, has the ux-ui-art-director agent critique the measured snapshots, iterates until elegant and correct, then records the approval that unblocks commit. Trigger on: build/implement/fix/redesign/style a component, page, screen, form, dashboard, modal, layout.

# UX/UI Builder — measure, critique, iterate, gate

## Host setup

Claude Code uses `/ux-ui:build` and its registered art director. Codex uses
`$ux-ui:build`; first read [references/host-codex.md](references/host-codex.md) for
MCP discovery, independent reviewer dispatch and hook trust.
`<plugin>` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when expanded by Claude Code, or the absolute
path two directories above this skill's directory on Codex. Resolve it from the
loaded SKILL.md path, never from the target project's working directory.

Agents implement UI poorly when they work from imagination. This skill removes
imagination from the loop: **every UI change is measured on the real render, critiqued
by an art director against the measured snapshots, and iterated until it is both
correct and elegant.** A commit hard-gate enforces it — you cannot commit UI that the
art director has not APPROVED against the exact staged diff.

Run this loop autonomously (no extra user prompting) whenever you build or change UI.

## Roles
- **You (main loop)** — plan, write the code, and MEASURE. You have the
  `chrome-devtools` MCP tools and the file tools. Measurement is *your* job and is
  mandatory; never hand the director imaginary states.
- **`ux-ui-art-director` agent** — critiques the measured artifacts and returns a
  verdict. It cannot edit code (reviewer/implementer separation). It may re-measure.
- **The gate** (`scripts/ui-commit-gate.sh`, wired as a PreToolUse hook) — blocks
  `git commit` of UI unless an APPROVED artifact matches the staged diff hash.

## References (read the relevant one when you reach that step)
- `references/design-principles.md` — the correctness + elegance bar (self-contained).
- `references/measurement-protocol.md` — the exact chrome-devtools capture protocol.
- `references/review-rubric.md` — verdict format + the APPROVED artifact contract.

## The loop

### 0. Bootstrap (self-check — zero-config)
- Confirm the `chrome-devtools` MCP tools are present in this session
  (Claude Code: `mcp__plugin_ux-ui_chrome-devtools__*`; Codex: discover the actual server tools). If missing, the plugin's MCP
  server failed to start (needs Node + Chrome). Tell the user how to fix, then stop.
- Find the dev server URL (project config; default `http://localhost:3000`). If it is
  not running, start it (prefer the project's own run/dev script) and wait until it
  responds. Never measure against a dead server.
- Pick a `<feature-slug>` for this change; artifacts live in `.ux-ui/measure/<slug>/`.

### 1. Plan the design (before writing code)
- Read `references/design-principles.md`. If the host project defines its own design
  rules (a `CLAUDE.md` design section, design tokens, a component library), read those
  — they win.
- Brainstorm a compact design intent for this specific feature: hierarchy, spacing
  scale, type roles, states, and the one signature element. Avoid the templated AI
  defaults called out in the principles. Keep this short; record it into
  `context.md` so the director knows the intent.

### 2. Build
- Implement the UI following the plan and existing app conventions. Reuse existing
  components/tokens; match the surrounding code's style.

### 3. Measure (mandatory — follow `references/measurement-protocol.md` exactly)
- Navigate, settle, and capture the required state × breakpoint matrix
  (default / hover / focus / loading / empty / error / long-content across
  mobile / tablet / desktop as applicable).
- Capture both screenshots and DOM/a11y snapshots. Record console errors, network
  failures, and a lighthouse audit.
- Write everything into `.ux-ui/measure/<slug>/` including `snapshots.md`,
  `signals.md`, and `context.md` (feature, route, what changed, design intent, which
  cells were skipped and why).

### 4. Critique (hard gate)
- Spawn the `ux-ui-art-director` through the host setup above. Give it the `.ux-ui/measure/<slug>/` path and
  the context. It reviews the measured artifacts and returns
  `VERDICT: APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUIRED` with findings (see `review-rubric.md`).

### 5. Iterate (autonomous, cap = 3)
- If `CHANGES_REQUIRED`: apply every critical/major finding exactly as instructed,
  then GO BACK TO STEP 3 (re-measure — the fix must be verified on the real render,
  not assumed). Re-critique with a fresh spawn of the director.
- Repeat until `APPROVED` or 3 cycles. If still not approved after 3, STOP and report
  the remaining blocking findings to the user. Do **not** write an approval — the
  commit stays blocked by design.

### 6. Record approval (unblocks commit)
- Only when the director returns `APPROVED`, run from the project root:
  `"<plugin>/scripts/ui-commit-gate.sh" approve <feature-slug> .ux-ui/measure/<slug>/`
  (stage your UI changes first — the approval is bound to the staged UI diff hash).
- This writes `.ux-ui/approvals/<hash>.json`. The gate will now allow the commit for
  exactly this diff. Any further UI edit changes the hash → re-run the loop.

## Rules
- Measurement is never optional and never faked. No screenshot → no review → no commit.
- The director judges only measured artifacts. If a state is missing, capture it.
- Fully autonomous: do not ask the user between steps; only stop at the cap-3 failure
  or a broken environment.
- The approval binds to the diff hash, so "approve once and keep editing" is impossible.
